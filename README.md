# TextStylometry

[TextStylometry](https://github.com/borh/TextStylometry.jl) is a Julia package for the stylometric analysis of texts.

# Status

TextStylometry is in early alpha with expected API changes to come before a stabler release around 2018/9.

# Goals

-   Provide native Julia implementations of stylometric measures.
-   Future plans are to include dispersion and collocation measures.
-   Scale to large datasets.

# Non-Goals

There are currently no plans for language-specific functionality.
This kind of functionality should sourced from other packages or built on top of this package.
